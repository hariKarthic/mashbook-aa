People are often busy with their schedule and most of the people have forgotten the habit of keep a daily dairy. This is an attempt to gently remind the users to take a snapshot of their day end 
an app in which one keeps a daily record of how the day was,  

This app will remind people  through a push-notification at specified time intervals to open up a webcam or the mobile cam to get a quick pic and add a few lines.
