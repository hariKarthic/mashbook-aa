# Scrapbook

An app in which one keeps a daily record of how the day was, with a "selfie of the day" or "Image of the day". People are often busy with their schedule and most of the people forgotten the habit of writing dairy. This app will be reminded people daily through a push-notification to write "How was their day".

This app works completely offline also.
