# Scrapbook

People are often busy with their schedule and most of the people forgotten the habit of writing dairy. This is an attempt to gently remind the users to store a snapshot at the end of their day with 
an app in which one keeps a daily record of how the day was, with an image captured either on their phones as a selfie or via a web cam. 

This app will remind people  through a push-notification at specified time intervals.
This app works completely offline also.
